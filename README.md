**Background:** I was born in Perth, Western Australia but lived in a small mining town in the Pilbara for the first few years of my life before my family moved to Perth. I began working in the Oil & Gas industry within the Logistics department in 2015 as an Administration Assistant and in 2017 started studying a Bachelor of Business majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management sponsored by my employer. I am due to complete my studies at the end of this year. I have two dogs which are both Australian Kelpies that keep me busy and active in my spare time. 

## Interest in IT

My interest in IT is in learning how to apply it to my work, I currently work as a materials controller and a large proportion of my day to day role is manual data entry and using excel spreadsheets and SAP. I began this role at the end of 2018 and seeing the amount of time spent doing manual work which I know could be at least semi-automated has sparked my interest in learning more about IT. One of the units required for my Bachelor is Business IT & Supply Chain and I chose Introduction to Information Technology as an elective to aide me in successfully completing my degree. I am studying my degree through Open Universities and when looking at my options to complete a Bachelor of Business decided on one that was the most relevant to me, RMIT is one of the best universities in Australia for Logistics & SCM.

My ideal job upon completion of my degree will be in the field of Logistics, I would like to complete a graduate program at a corporation that has a dedicated function for Logistics with opportunities to rotate through different areas of the business for further career development. I would like the chance to apply my current experience and learnings from my degree into a Logistics based role and believe a graduate role is a great opportunity to allow for this and provide me a good base insight into a company of choice. I chose this job advertisement out of one of many graduate opportunities within Australia for Logistics graduates. This one as well as the many others I looked at are looking for recent university graduates with newly acquired knowledge of Logistics, Business or Commerce with no real work experience required. I currently have 5 years’ experience working within a Logistics function where I have learned a lot about the business itself and 15 months experience in a Logistics core role where I have learnt more technical skills. Once I have completed my degree I will have 7 years industry experience, 2 years technical experience and a relevant tertiary qualification making me an ideal candidate for the graduate program in most industries’.

## Personal Profile

The first test I completed was the Myers-Briggs test which resulted in my personality type being Virtuoso ISTP-T, looking through the Mind, Energy, Nature, Tactics and Identity breakdown it is very similar to how I would have thought my result would be and are accurate in how I have seen myself work within a team in the past. The results showed that I have a 81% introverted personality type which is slightly  higher than I would have predicted, this could mean that it will take me some time to warm up to my team members and be comfortable speaking up in collaboration sessions. I had a 55% "Observant" energy result which indicates that I prefer factual information with predicted outcomes and I'm less likely to have my mind drift during conversations vs someone with a higher intuitive perosnality. It means that I am focused to get a job done and will be very hands on in team projects. My tactics portion of the results showed that my approach to work is 65% "Prospecting" vs 35% "Judging" which means I'm flexible when it comes to dealing with unexpected challenges which helps me when approaching new opportunities and won't get overwhelmed if their is a change to plan which is a good attidude to have when working in a dynamic team environment. The nature trait was close to 50/50 result with thinking being slightly higher than feeling at 53% which I think is a good balance to have, I'm a little more likely to take a scientific approach to problems and slightly better at making important decisions but it means I do take my feelings into account but will be more likely to listen to my head when making choices. My moderately higher result on the turbulent side of the identity trait means I tend to be anxious in new environments but because of this anxiety I will spend more time preparing for a meeting or event than the more assertive personality. 

The second test I completed was a learning style test which again gave me a result that was not surprising, It profiled me as being a verbal learner being someone that is good with anything word related whether it is written or oral, It indicates that I'm a good listener and retain information given to me by others verablly or via text which I believe shows that I would be a great team member, my team mates could trust once they have given me new information I will run with it and won't need to be reminded to follow up on something or ask them to repeat themselves. 

Finally, I chose to complete a leadership style quiz which suggested that I have a more democratic leadership style which means that I encourage team members to give me and eachother feedback to improve the team dynamic and buld trust and respect and my team will believe in my ideas and feel empowered to contribute but I need to learn to be more authoratitive when there are deadlines to be met or conflict within the team. I think that this leadership style could be good at building a good culture within the team and would be good for skilled employees who want to be trusted to make decisions in their role.

Knowing the above information would help guide me in knowing what areas I would need to consciouslly focus into when within a team such as being more assetive and quicker to add in input but I would also try to form a diverse team personality wise to ensure there are some team members who are good at seeing the big picture of a project and some more extroverted and assertive personality types to allow a more balanced team dynamic. 

## Project Idea

**Overview:** The project is a small GPS device that can be sewn into a pets collar. The GPS device can send coordinates to a mobile app. The device would be used to locate your pet in the event that they run away. The device could have the alternative use of displaying the distance travelled by the pet which could be converted into an estimated step count.

**Why is it important:** This device could help speed up the process of finding a lost pet. Without a device like this you would need to wait untill the animal is found by someone who could contact you to notify you by using the phone number on their collar ( if they are wearing one), dropped off by someone to the vets or even picked up by a ranger. In the meantime the pet could run into traffic or other animals and sustain an injury. According to statistics 14% to 15% of cat and dog owners will lose their pets in a five year period (Lost Pet Statistics, 2019). For that percentage a device like this could be a serious relief especially if the pet is prone to escaping.

**Motivation:** I am motivated by this project as when I lost my dog on a walk through a national park it resulted in several hours of searching for him only to discover after 18kms of walking he had been collected to spend the night with the rangers. I found out that he was only a few hundred meters away at a nearby house for 1-2hrs before the ranger collected him, at the time he did not have a phone number on his collar. Prior to this he also escaped from our backyard and crossed a major road I was notified by the owners of a local property that he wandered onto and spent some time with them that day, therefore a device such as this would put me at ease.

**Description:** The device is a small and lightweight microcontroller, GPS module and battery within a pet collar. The collar would be made out of a waterproof material to protect the electronics inside. The user of the device should be able to locate their pet via a phone app. The app would display the GPS coordinates over a map. This would be useful in the event that the pet escapes. The mobile app could have the secondary features of push notifications if the pet meets a step goal, or leaves a set boundary. 

**Tools and Technologies:** This device would need to fit in a collar. Therefore the hardware must be lightweight with small dimensions. I am considering an Arduino Beetle by DFrobot for its small size of 22 x 20mm (Beetle - The smallest Arduino Micrcontroller, 2020). A GPS module would be required to take position and send them to a server. As such a server or some way of collecting and storing that data will be required and lastly a power supply will also be required.

Similar projects have been attempted online. A fairly simple version is available via teachmemicro.com where they use some relatively simple technique to display coordinates with a time and date (Arduino GPS Tutorial, 2018). As such following these could help with any issues during production. Some required tech would be the ‘tiny gps++’ library which can take latitude and longitude from a GPS module. (How To Interface GPS With Arduino using tiny gps++, 2020). Learning the Arduino IDE and C programming would also be required. Creating the mobile app would be a project on its own. I would have to follow a basic tutorial on android development which may involve programming in a separate language. Ie java for the mobile app, but C for the microcontroller (Build your first app, 2019). This would then lead into how to implement maps and display the latitude and longitude coordinates. As this could be time consuming i would likely prototype with a web based solution and have the mobile app as a late in development feature.

**Skills required:** I would need to learn how to program as well as how to use an Arduino. I would need to learn how a GPS sends and receives data as well as how to store that data. The information that has been received from the GPS unit would need to be accessible via a mobile app therefore i would need to learn how to create a simple mobile app to display GPS coordinates. 
I would also need to learn about electronics as the device will require power. I would need to find a compromise between the size of the battery pack and how long the device can run between charges. 

**Setbacks:** I foresee that power consumption will be the biggest setback on this project. Some compromise can possibly be made by changing how often the GPS device operates. For example, only updating position every 10 mins or longer instead of constantly. Or perhaps the device only powers up when activated via the app. 

**Outcome:** If this project is successful then I could potentially locate my pet if they run away again. If the device was of decent quality without design flaws it could also potentially be made into a commercial product. Given how lengthy the skills section is I would also learn a significant amount about hardware, programming, app design, electronics ect. which would be great for not only personal growth but as a potential resume booster.
