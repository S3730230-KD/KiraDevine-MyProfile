# hello-world
**Personal Information:** Kira Devine, s3730230, s3730230@student.rmit.edu.au
I was born in Perth, Western Australia but lived in a small mining town in the Pilbara for the first few years of my life before my family moved to Perth. I began working in the Oil & Gas industry within the Logistics department in 2015 as an Administration Assistant and in 2017 started studying a Bachelor of Business majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management sponsored by my employer. I am due to complete my studies at the end of this year. I have two dogs which are both Australian Kelpies that keep me busy and active in my spare time. 

**Interest in IT:** My interest in IT is in learning how to apply it to my work, I currently work as a materials controller and a large proportion of my day to day role is manual data entry and using excel spreadsheets and SAP. I began this role at the end of 2018 and seeing the amount of time spent doing manual work which I know could be at least semi-automated has sparked my interest in learning more about IT. One of the units required for my Bachelor is Busines IT & Supply Chain and I chose Introduction to Information Technology as an elective to aide me in succesfully completing my degree. I am studying my degree through Open Universities and when looking at my options to completed a Bachelor of Business decided on one that was the most relevant to me, RMIT is one of the best univeristies in Australia for Logistics & SCM.
