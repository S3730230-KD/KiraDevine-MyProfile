**Background:** I was born in Perth, Western Australia but lived in a small mining town in the Pilbara for the first few years of my life before my family moved to Perth. I began working in the Oil & Gas industry within the Logistics department in 2015 as an Administration Assistant and in 2017 started studying a Bachelor of Business majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management sponsored by my employer. I am due to complete my studies at the end of this year. I have two dogs which are both Australian Kelpies that keep me busy and active in my spare time. 

## Interest in IT

My interest in IT is in learning how to apply it to my work, I currently work as a materials controller and a large proportion of my day to day role is manual data entry and using excel spreadsheets and SAP. I began this role at the end of 2018 and seeing the amount of time spent doing manual work which I know could be at least semi-automated has sparked my interest in learning more about IT. One of the units required for my Bachelor is Busines IT & Supply Chain and I chose Introduction to Information Technology as an elective to aide me in succesfully completing my degree. I am studying my degree through Open Universities and when looking at my options to completed a Bachelor of Business decided on one that was the most relevant to me, RMIT is one of the best univeristies in Australia for Logistics & SCM.

## Project Idea

**Overview:** The project is a small GPS device that can be sewn into a pets collar. The GPS device can send coordinates to a mobile app. The device would be used to locate your pet in the event that they run away. The device could have the alternative use of displaying the distance travelled by the pet which could be converted into an estimated step count.

**Why is it important:** This device could help speed up the process of finding a lost pet. Without a device like this you would need to wait untill the animal is found by someone who could contact you to notify you by using the phone number on their collar ( if they are wearing one), dropped off by someone to the vets or even picked up by a ranger. In the meantime the pet could run into traffic or other animals and sustain an injury. According to statistics 14% to 15% of cat and dog owners will lose their pets in a five year period (Lost Pet Statistics, 2019). For that percentage a device like this could be a serious relief especially if the pet is prone to escaping.

**Motivation:** I am motivated by this project as when I lost my dog on a walk through a national park it resulted in several hours of searching for him only to discover after 18kms of walking he had been collected to spend the night with the rangers. I found out that he was only a few hundred meters away at a nearby house for 1-2hrs before the ranger collected him, at the time he did not have a phone number on his collar. Prior to this he also escaped from our backyard and crossed a major road I was notified by the owners of a local property that he wandered onto and spent some time with them that day, therefore a device such as this would put me at ease.

**Description:** The device is a small and lightweight microcontroller, GPS module and battery within a pet collar. The collar would be made out of a waterproof material to protect the electronics inside. The user of the device should be able to locate their pet via a phone app. The app would display the GPS coordinates over a map. This would be useful in the event that the pet escapes. The mobile app could have the secondary features of push notifications if the pet meets a step goal, or leaves a set boundary. 

**Tools and Technologies:** This device would need to fit in a collar. Therefore the hardware must be lightweight with small dimensions. I am considering an Arduino Beetle by DFrobot for its small size of 22 x 20mm (Beetle - The smallest Arduino Micrcontroller, 2020). A GPS module would be required to take position and send them to a server. As such a server or some way of collecting and storing that data will be required and lastly a power supply will also be required.

Similar projects have been attempted online. A fairly simple version is available via teachmemicro.com where they use some relatively simple technique to display coordinates with a time and date (Arduino GPS Tutorial, 2018). As such following these could help with any issues during production. Some required tech would be the ‘tiny gps++’ library which can take latitude and longitude from a GPS module. (How To Interface GPS With Arduino using tiny gps++, 2020). Learning the Arduino IDE and C programming would also be required. Creating the mobile app would be a project on its own. I would have to follow a basic tutorial on android development which may involve programming in a separate language. Ie java for the mobile app, but C for the microcontroller (Build your first app, 2019). This would then lead into how to implement maps and display the latitude and longitude coordinates. As this could be time consuming i would likely prototype with a web based solution and have the mobile app as a late in development feature.

**Skills required:** I would need to learn how to program as well as how to use an Arduino. I would need to learn how a GPS sends and receives data as well as how to store that data. The information that has been received from the GPS unit would need to be accessible via a mobile app therefore i would need to learn how to create a simple mobile app to display GPS coordinates. 
I would also need to learn about electronics as the device will require power. I would need to find a compromise between the size of the battery pack and how long the device can run between charges. 

**Setbacks:** I foresee that power consumption will be the biggest setback on this project. Some compromise can possibly be made by changing how often the GPS device operates. For example only updating position every 10 mins or longer instead of constantly. Or perhaps the device only powers up when activated via the app. 

**Outcome:** If this project is successful then I could potentially locate my pet if they run away again. If the device was of decent quality without design flaws it could also potentially be made into a commercial product. Gven how lengthy the skills section is I would also learn a significant amount about hardware, programming, app design, electronics ect. which would be great for not only personal growth but as a potential resume booster.
